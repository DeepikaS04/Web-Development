            <b><u>E. T. A. Hoffmann, ‘The Golden Pot’.</u> </b> <br>
            Before Edgar Allan Poe, there was Hoffmann (1776-1822), who was an even earlier pioneer of the short story form as well as an influential early writer of what we now call fantasy literature. He was associated with the Romantic movement, and Hoffmann’s work shows a fascination with the romance and folklore surrounding such things as toys which come to life, witches who can grant wishes, and other ‘fantastical’ things.
            
            And although he is probably best-known for writing the story which Tchaikovsky turned into The Nutcracker and for penning ‘The Sandman’ (creepy Gothic horror classic), ‘The Golden Pot’ may be his best story.
            
        
            <br>
            ‘The Golden Pot’ is about a student, Anselmus, who inadvertently offends a witch one day; the witch sets about trying to destroy his life using all manner of supernatural tricks and scare tactics, but Anselmus has a guardian-spirit (who takes the form of a serpent) to watch over him. What ensues is an enchanting fantasy story, a quest of sorts, which sees Anselmus trying to overcome his nemesis and fall in love with the female spirit who is devoted to protecting him.

           <b><u>Washington Irving, ‘The Legend of Sleepy Hollow’.</u> </b> <br>
Memorably filmed by Tim Burton in a 1999 adaptation that changed a number of details of Irving’s original story, ‘The Legend of Sleepy Hollow’ is, along with ‘Rip Van Winkle’, Irving’s best-known work. 
First published in 1820, the story is variously regarded as a Gothic tale and a modern folk story about the early history of the United States of America. One night, the schoolmaster Ichabod Crane attends a harvest party and listens to ghostly legends told by a man named Brom Bones. Crane fails to win his sweetheart’s hand in marriage and rides home, his superstitious imagination working overtime following the ghostly accounts he had heard at the party. While undertaking this journey, he encounters what appears to be the ghostly headless horseman …
